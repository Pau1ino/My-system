Notes

Some of the things I think would be cool. 

- Journal Entry with timestamp
- a calendar section, when you make an entry you get an email
- A reminder section (make it annoying so it cant be ignored)
- Relationship manager page.  this can help you stay in touch
- Goal breakdown page to help you chunk it down and you can check off items as you make progress
- A habit tracker
- tbd
